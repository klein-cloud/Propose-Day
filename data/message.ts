After catching a glance of you in the concert, I developed a crush on some unknown girl. When you first texted me in FB, I thought this is fate. Since, that day we talked a lot, for an entire year. Every moment with you, irl or virtual....I feel the happiest.

You're the most beautiful girl in my life. You're my first and only love. I will cherish you forever. I love you a lot.

— With all my love, 2 takar Rand`,
